title: The Robot Soul
abstract: The largest impact of the discovery of a robotic soul will not be on Robots, but on humans that interact with them. Therefore the sooner we find it, the better, for human’s sake and certainly for Robot’s sake.<br>"We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are." - Anais Nin
