title: FabLab Brussels - How We Work
abstract: Lieven Standaert &amp; Yannick Verbelen brought a number of their CNC-machines and 3D-printers to the camp. During the camp everybody who is interested can learn to use these machines. There are no workshops though.<br>In this short talk Lieven shows how over the past 2 years the team from Fablab Brussels has developed a series of hands-on tutorials, which new users need to work through before using each machine.<br>He explains how they manage to run the lab effectively by avoiding one-on-one machine instructions and how educators can teach better by talking less.
