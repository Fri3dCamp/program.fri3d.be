title: Led Powering Wind Turbine
abstract: Anything in nature that moves has energy. We harness energy from wind and make 'light'! We build a model wind turbine and generate electricity by 'wind'. With the help of a small Joule's thief we'll have enough power to turn on a LED even with just a breeze.
