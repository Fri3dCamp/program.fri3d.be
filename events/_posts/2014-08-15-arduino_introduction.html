title: Arduino Introduction
abstract: In a list of the greatest things that Italy ever produced, Arduino is at number 3, after pizza and ice cream (with lasagna being fourth, of course). The Arduino is a small microcontroller board that can easily be hooked up to any host device with a USB port, and programmed through a very easy to use programming interface. With an Arduino as brain, adding intelligence to any electronics project becomes child's play and prototype ideas can be done in a matter of hours or even minutes. An Arduino is also a great tool for hacking electronics. It can be used as a logic analyzer and a computer controlled data acquisition module. Thousands of projects and code samples can be found on the Internet already, and the possibilities are only limited by imagination. In this workshop, Yannick Verbelen introduces the Arduino to those who have never programmed a microcontroller before. Some experience with programming is useful but not required to attend this workshop. Arduinos and other equipment will be provided for up to 5 participants, you'll only have to bring a laptop.
