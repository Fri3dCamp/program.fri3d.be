title: Tweenbots
abstract: A Tweenbot is a simple robot that by itself simply drives forward. It depends on interaction with people in its surroundings to complete its mission. Such a mission can consist of getting from point A to point B, but there is no real limit. It could try to collect autographs, fetch something,... It all starts with a basic structure that can be extended in a creative way. Finally the Tweenbots are releases amongst the people on the site with a written assignment and we can start observing them and watch the interaction with the people around them.<br>Yvon provides the material to make a basic Tweenbot. If you bring some addition carton boxes, you can really customize the Tweenbots.
