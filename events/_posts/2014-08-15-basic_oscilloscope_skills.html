title: Basic Oscilloscope Skills
abstract: An oscilloscope is the eye of every electronics hacker. It shows what otherwise remains invisible, and allows the hacker to peek into a working system to take a look what is going (wr)on(g). And of course, they create pretty fancy colored graphs on a screen! In this workshop, Yannick Verbelen introduces the oscilloscope as electronic measurement device and demonstrates its importance in electronic prototyping and debugging. Feel free to bring your own electronic devices to probe to this workshop!
