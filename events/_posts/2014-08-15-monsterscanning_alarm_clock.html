title: Monsterscanning Alarm Clock
abstract: Koen's 4 year old has troubles with the time to go to bed or get up - especially during summer. When at 4AM he calls out "Is it morning yet?", it tends to upset Koen and every other parent who has been through this. <br>Therefore Koen started a little project to build an alarm clock to put onhis bedside table. It gives him a visual interpretation of the current time, telling him what he should be doing right now - sleep, get up,... <br>Of course, the project got a bit out of hand. Built around a Raspberry Pi, with a PiTFT touch screen and custom printed housing, it currently provides his son with a clock, ephemeris, a slideshow with pictures and a monster-scanner that counts the number of monsters in his room. <br>Although the project isn't finished yet, Koen wants to show us the current state, showing how things came together, how Python and PyGame helped him create the software and probably will have some future ideas that he wants to share.
