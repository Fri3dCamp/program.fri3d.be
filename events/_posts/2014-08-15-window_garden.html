title: Window Garden
abstract: A short 10 minute talk to introduce the idea into the community. How I built mine. Some of the experiments I have been running. Things you got to know about plants, soil and nutrients. People should grow something even if it is only a basil plant because we should be in touch with our food. It is what keeps us alive.
