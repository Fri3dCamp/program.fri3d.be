layout: event
title: Lego Mindstorms
abstract: Anders will explain to other kids and/or adults how Lego Mindstorms works. And then show a little bit what can be done - how to use a motor, how to use a sensor, how to use a controlling device. Maybe he also gets into programming the EV3 brick with the computer (if we get there). Klaas will try to let Anders do it, but of course will help him to explain things so that it is an educational session to the attendees. 
host: Klaas and Anders Bals
location: Social Hangar - Main Stage
start: Sat 16 @ 17h00
duration: 20min
audience: everybody
