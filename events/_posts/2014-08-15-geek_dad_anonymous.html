title: Geek Dad Anonymous
abstract: Admit it, our kids/partners have to cope with out geeky way of life. To watch TV 7 cables need to be connected in the correct way, because we want to manager our AV-experience using our homemade software. You can't use any of the 10 tablets in the house because dad needs them all. And when you finally have bought your own, dad needs it to test just a little thing.<br>During this half hour we want to bring kids and geek dads together and talk this through.
