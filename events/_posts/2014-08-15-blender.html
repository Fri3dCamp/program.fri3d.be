title: Blender
abstract: In this workshop, we'll be modeling a simple 3d object in Blender (most likely a nice smelling cup of coffee). Blender is open source software for 3D modeling and animation (www.blender.org). You will learn some of the basic modeling commands and learn how to render a scene using Cycles.<br>Participants can bring their own laptops and join the workshop interactively, but you can also follow the workshop on the screen without a laptop. I'll provide a few usb sticks with the software, just come 5-10 minutes earlier for installing the software prior to the workshop.<br>No previous knowledge is required, just an interest in 3D modeling. After the workshop you are able to start building your own simple 3D objects (e.g. for 3D printing).
