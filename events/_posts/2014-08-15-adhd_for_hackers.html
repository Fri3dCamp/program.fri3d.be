title: AD(H)D for Hackers
abstract: A no-nonsense talk outlining what ADHD is, how it affects an average hacker (or its kid!), what are its (dis)advantages and how it can be treated. We talk from a perspective of a psychologist, a hacker and as a family dealing with it.<br>Our goal is to raise awareness among a crowd that is more than average likely to suffer from this disorder. Also, we want to raise money for AD(H)D research by collecting donations for www.adhdfund.com We plan to operate a donation based coffee table offering Senseo (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senseo) coffee.
