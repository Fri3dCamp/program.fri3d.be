title: Lock Picking 101
abstract: Lock picking is the art and science of opening locks without the key and without force (but with consent of the owner). In the lecture, Walter will explain just why it is that picking locks is possible. He will describe the basic technique, but also pick guns and bumping. He will look into several techniques that manufacturers use to make lock picking harder - and how to defeat those.
