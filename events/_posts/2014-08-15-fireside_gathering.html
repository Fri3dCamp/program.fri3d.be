title: Fireside Gathering
abstract: Games are no longer the exclusive domain of basement dwelling geeks who play at least 20 hours a day. In this workshop, Yannick Verbelen introduces a light and easy to begin with digital card game as an example of casual gaming, and demonstrates that games do not necessarily have to include violence nor be a full time occupation. Let's gather around the camp fire and challenge each other for a game that anyone can learn in a matter of minutes and enjoy. Be sure to bring your own tablet or laptop along!
