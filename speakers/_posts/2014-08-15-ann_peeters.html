name: Ann Peeters
bio: me =  playful, multi-interest, biking-to-work, game-addicted, love-to-learn, sun-adoring, creative,  enthusiastic t/h/inkerer. Working as a coordinator in the social sector, where I help to close the digital divide by coaching a team of about 20 people without formal training to teach IT and multimedia to grownups and kids that live in social insecure situations. Background in theatre, performance and I still love doing all kinds of fun, interactive projects. Experience in facilitating all kinds of workshops while promoting creativity (drama, video, game design, tinkering,...)<br>Also kinda geeky for a girl...
