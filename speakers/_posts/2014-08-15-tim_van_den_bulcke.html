name: Time Van den Bulcke
bio: At daytime I am research coordinator biomedical informatics at the Antwerp University Hospital. In my - often limited - spare time I've been doing several hobby projects, among which home automation with Arduino/Raspberry Pi, some 3D modeling/printing (e.g. silver necklace hanger for my wife), laser cutting a chess game set, launched a weather balloon into 'space' with children drawings, made a solar oven. Currently most of my spare time goes in renovating our (soon to be) new house, which is somewhat less inspirational and more transpirational, yet very rewarding!
