name: Erik Vanderhasselt
bio: Erik works as a security analyst during the day and has been playing little scientist since he was a little boy. Intrigued by the world around him he started like so many with opening things, adding over the counter chemicals together and liked cooking. He went on holiday to Canada last year and saw in Vancouver urban gardening projects which he thought were interesting. At the beginning of this year he heard about the project called window farms and wanted to try it out.
hosts: [ "Window Garden" ]
