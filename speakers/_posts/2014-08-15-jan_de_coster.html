name: Jan De Coster
bio: Jan De Coster grew up with a fascination for physics, science fiction stories and hacking stuff. In college he realized that the stories around science, were a lot more appealing than the theory behind it. So he dropped out and started working in advertising, making stories and games for online campaigns. Until he got tired of virtual worlds and he started making interactive machines in the real world. And then, finally, everything started to come together and his mission is now to make science fiction stories more down to earth, by making imperfect robots and cybernetic installations that donâ€™t make people stronger but rather more vulnerable and exposed.<br><a href="http://www.slightlyoverdone.be">http://www.slightlyoverdone.be</a>.
