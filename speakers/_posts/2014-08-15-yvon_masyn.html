name: Yvon Masyn
bio: For over 15 years my main hobby is developing and giving creative workshops for children (and sometimes adults) - rockets, mousetrap cars, solar powered vehicles, hovercrafts, simple robots... I also like to make things just for fun (with indoor RC blimps being a main theme) or as presents (dolls, rings...).<br>I do the workshops mostly on Saturdays at the school my daughters attend, Leefschool Klavertje 4, but also at many other occasions.<br>Instructables is the main platform for me to "show and tell" about my projects. You can find me on Instructables under the name "masynmachien". See <a href="http://www.instructables.com/member/masynmachien/">http://www.instructables.com/member/masynmachien/</a> for more info.<br>During the month of July 2013 I've had the luck to be an "Artist in Residence" at Instructables HQ, San Francisco. My main project there was an iPhone controlled blimp with video feedback (<a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/In-a-Blimp-of-an-Eye/">http://www.instructables.com/id/In-a-Blimp-of-an-Eye/</a>).<br>I'm a Timelab member since June 2013.<br>Years ago, when I was among makers, their average age used to be around 9. But, these recent times, with the maker movement taking off, it is great to meet other makers of all ages and interests, through Instructables, Timelab, Maker Faires and great initiatives like Fri3d. For some children's workshops presented in Dutch, see my old website at <a href="http://users.telenet.be/masynmachien/">http://users.telenet.be/masynmachien/</a>
