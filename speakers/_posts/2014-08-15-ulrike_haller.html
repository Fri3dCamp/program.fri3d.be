bio: I'm a geeky girl from Germany who loves to be artistic with all kinds of material, but especially digital Art and design got me hooked up. I'm interested in Computer and Electronics since I was a little kid and love to keep learning new things. I'm myself teaching kids at the age of 2 - 6 as kindergarten teacher.
