This repository contains the website for the program of Fri3d Camp 2014.

It is built using HTML + Bootstrap and GitHub Pages and Jekyll. Bundler is
required to generate and verify the site. See
https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages for help on setting up
your environment.

Fork, edit and provide me with a pull request and I'll push it online.

Minimal survival instructions:
$ git clone https://github.com/christophevg/program.fri3d.be
$ cd program.fri3d.be
$ bundle update

Do some editing.

$ bundle exec jekyll serve

Check http://localhost:4000 to validate the site. Check all links! Twice!
